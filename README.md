# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales based on several key factors, including gender, occupation, state, amount, age group, and product category. The aim is to identify purchasing patterns during the Diwali festival and understand customer segmentation to optimize future marketing and sales strategies.

The analysis is performed using Python for initial data exploration and visualization, followed by a Power BI dashboard for detailed visual representation and insights.
